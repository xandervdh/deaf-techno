                            Important: if you wish to stay on one of the festival's campsites, you'll need to purchase a

                        <p>
                            ⚠️ Buy your tickets from the official ticketing channels only - www.proximusgoformusic.be
                            and www.ticketmaster.be. Don't blindly order your tickets through the first website that
                            pops up on your search engine. Chances are you are visiting an auctioning website or a
                            ticket reseller. Not only will tickets offered through these websites be more expensive; you
                            also risk being denied access to the festival. Click here for more info.
                            <br/><br/>
                            There is a legal framework in Belgium that curbs the resale of tickets. The law of 30 July
                            2013 concerning the sale of tickets to events states that:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The occasional resale of tickets is allowed if the sale price is not higher than the
                                definitive price that is on the ticket.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The non-occasional or regular reselling, or making platforms available where
                                non-occasional resale can take place or where the price can exceed the maximum permitted
                                price is prohibited.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The sale of free tickets, invitations, sponsor tickets or special offers of tickets
                                before the official sale date is prohibited.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The victim of above mentioned practices can reclaim from the reseller the excess amount
                                paid.
                            </li>

                            Nevertheless, the trade in festival tickets on parallel markets is rampant. Contrary to
                            tickets purchased via the official ticket channels, tickets purchased on the black market do
                            not guarantee validity. All too often we find that fraudulent tickets are offered via these
                            channels. It is possible that tickets purchased on a parallel market are on the blacklist,
                            so the access to the festival will be refused.

                            Fortunately the days of hotdogs, hamburgers and fries with mayonnaise are long gone. For
                            quite a while now there has been a far wider range of food available at Rock Werchter; and
                            the highly varied selection means there’s something for everyone. You can choose from
                            healthy salads, oysters, tasty pasta, Asian cuisine, premium burgers, crusty sandwiches, the
                            first mussels of the season, wraps, stir fries, healthy smoothies, fruit and plenty more
                            besides. There are vegetarian and gluten-free options too. Beer and refreshing drinks are
                            available from drinks stalls scattered all over the festival ground. Specialized stalls
                            offer coffee, milk, fruit juice, wine and cava as well. Drink/food coupons - available in
                            presale - enable you to purchase both food and drink in the festival park.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Good to know: for 1 drinks voucher, you get a 0.5l bottle of Spa Reine water. Always.
                            Because we think it is important that festival goers drink enough water. In hot weather, we
                            actually recommend drinking a lot of water. Drinking water is provided in different ways on
                            the festival grounds. You can freely use the taps with drinking water at the sanitary blocks
                            spread out over the festival grounds.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Important: it is forbidden to give, offer or sell alcoholic drinks to anyone under the age
                            of 16. That's the law. If you are under 16 please respect this law. If you are over 16,
                            please be aware that you are forbidden to buy alcohol for anyone under the age of 16 or to
                            offer them alcoholic drinks. For beverages containing more than 1,2% of distilled alcohol
                            (eg. cocktails, gin-tonic, etc.), this minimum age is 18.

                        <p>
                            <b>An explicit ban on crowd surfing</b>
                            <br/><br/>
                            Crowd surfing is banned at Werchter, as it is at all the big festivals in Europe. It means
                            that the people at the front can enjoy everything that’s happening on stage without
                            constantly having to protect themselves. It is also much safer and much more pleasant for
                            all, and reduces the risk of injury considerably. Therefore, expect to be removed from the
                            festival grounds if you fail to observe this rule.
                            <br/><br/>
                            <b>Safety corridors</b>
                            <br/><br/>
                            Constructions are set up in front of the stage in order to increase visitor comfort and
                            safety. Our pioneering role has inspired many major festivals all over the world to set up
                            similar systems. Safety corridors consist of solid constructions with freestanding barriers
                            which, in the event of an emergency situation, enable safety and first-aid staff to carry
                            out interventions at a significant distance from the stage. These corridors absorb part of
                            the forward and sidelong crowd pressure.
                            <br/><br/>
                            <b>Solid floor</b>
                            <br/><br/>
                            herefore, solid flooring is installed in front of the Main Stage. KluB C and The Barn are
                            fully floored. No mud, no slippery situations.
                            <br/><br/>
                            <b>Video screen</b>
                            <br/><br/>
                            There are huge video screens on both sides of each stage. This enables people standing
                            farther from the stage to fully enjoy what is going on on stage. Another big screen is
                            installed outside KluB C and The Barn. The screen will be placed in between both tents,
                            which have programming taking turns. If one of them reaches its full capacity, the screen
                            outside is switched on and you’ll be able to watch the show there, too. At your service!

                            There is an ATM by KBC available on the festival grounds. Cash payments are still an option

                        <h3>YOUR FESTIVAL BRACELET = YOUR KEY TO THE FESTIVAL!</h3>
                        <p>
                            Rock Werchter wristbands have been fitted with an RFID chip for a few years now. At the
                            festival entrance you are given a chipped wristband in return for scanning in your festival
                            ticket. As of that point the RFID chip in the wristband is literally your key to the
                            festival. As was the case before, a fabric wristband, or long before that merely a stamp,
                            served as your key once the ticket had been checked.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Important: your entrance wristband and RFID chip must be worn at all times. It is your key
                            to the festival. You will not be allowed into the festival grounds without a wristband (and
                            without a chip). The RFID chip is not linked to your personal data.

                            In collaboration with Inter, Rock Werchter puts in a great effort to make the festival
                            accessible to the disabled. So we have paid a lot of attention to the accessibility of the
                            festival site and its surroundings:

                                There is an alternative, accessible and less crowded entrance for visitors with a
                                disability. One person is allowed to accompany him/her through this entrance.

                                Both at the Main Stage, KluB C and The Barn, we have provided viewing platforms for

                                artists. We want to make sure that as many people as possible can use the platforms;
                                therefore only one friend/carer can accompany the festivalgoer with a disability on to
                                the platform.
