                            Each e-festival ticket allows you to download one free e-train ticket for public transport

                            <br/><br/>
                            Important: if you wish to stay on one of the festival's campsites, you'll need to purchase a
                            camping ticket as well.

                        <p>
                            ⚠️ Buy your tickets from the official ticketing channels only. Don't blindly order your
                            tickets through the first website that
                            pops up on your search engine. Chances are you are visiting an auctioning website or a
                            ticket reseller. Not only will tickets offered through these websites be more expensive; you
                            also risk being denied access to the festival.
                            <br/><br/>
                            There is a legal framework in Belgium that curbs the resale of tickets. The law of 30 July
                            2013 concerning the sale of tickets to events states that:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The occasional resale of tickets is allowed if the sale price is not higher than the
                                definitive price that is on the ticket.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The non-occasional or regular reselling, or making platforms available where
                                non-occasional resale can take place or where the price can exceed the maximum permitted
                                price is prohibited.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The sale of free tickets, invitations, sponsor tickets or special offers of tickets
                                before the official sale date is prohibited.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The victim of above mentioned practices can reclaim from the reseller the excess amount
                                paid.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Nevertheless, the trade in festival tickets on parallel markets is rampant. Contrary to
                            tickets purchased via the official ticket channels, tickets purchased on the black market do
                            not guarantee validity. All too often we find that fraudulent tickets are offered via these
                            channels. It is possible that tickets purchased on a parallel market are on the blacklist,
                            so the access to the festival will be refused.

                        <p>
                            <br/><br/>
                            Fortunately the days of hotdogs, hamburgers and fries with mayonnaise are long gone. For
                            quite a while now there has been a far wider range of food available at Deaf Techno; and
                            the highly varied selection means there’s something for everyone. You can choose from
                            healthy salads, oysters, tasty pasta, Asian cuisine, premium burgers, crusty sandwiches, the
                            first mussels of the season, wraps, stir fries, healthy smoothies, fruit and plenty more
                            besides. There are vegetarian and gluten-free options too. Beer and refreshing drinks are
                            available from drinks stalls scattered all over the festival ground. Specialized stalls
                            offer coffee, milk, fruit juice, wine and cava as well. Drink/food coupons - available in
                            presale - enable you to purchase both food and drink in the festival park.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Good to know: for 1 drinks voucher, you get a 0.5l bottle of Spa Reine water. Always.
                            Because we think it is important that festival goers drink enough water. In hot weather, we
                            actually recommend drinking a lot of water. Drinking water is provided in different ways on
                            the festival grounds. You can freely use the taps with drinking water at the sanitary blocks
                            spread out over the festival grounds.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Important: it is forbidden to give, offer or sell alcoholic drinks to anyone under the age
                            of 16. That's the law. If you are under 16 please respect this law. If you are over 16,
                            please be aware that you are forbidden to buy alcohol for anyone under the age of 16 or to
                            offer them alcoholic drinks. For beverages containing more than 1,2% of distilled alcohol
                            (eg. cocktails, gin-tonic, etc.), this minimum age is 18.

                        <p>
                            <b>An explicit ban on crowd surfing</b>
                            <br/><br/>
                            Crowd surfing is banned at Deaf Techno, as it is at all the big festivals in Europe. It
                            means
                            that the people at the front can enjoy everything that’s happening on stage without
                            constantly having to protect themselves. It is also much safer and much more pleasant for
                            all, and reduces the risk of injury considerably. Therefore, expect to be removed from the
                            festival grounds if you fail to observe this rule.
                            <br/><br/>
                            <b>Safety corridors</b>
                            <br/><br/>
                            Constructions are set up in front of the stage in order to increase visitor comfort and
                            safety. Our pioneering role has inspired many major festivals all over the world to set up
                            similar systems. Safety corridors consist of solid constructions with freestanding barriers
                            which, in the event of an emergency situation, enable safety and first-aid staff to carry
                            out interventions at a significant distance from the stage. These corridors absorb part of
                            the forward and sidelong crowd pressure.
                            <br/><br/>
                            <b>Solid floor</b>

                            herefore, solid flooring is installed in front of the Main Stage. KluB C and The Barn are
                            fully floored. No mud, no slippery situations.
                            <br/><br/>

                            <br/><br/>
                            There are huge video screens on both sides of each stage. This enables people standing
                            farther from the stage to fully enjoy what is going on on stage. Another big screen is
                            installed outside club underground and the techno rave tent. The screen will be placed in
                            between both tents,
                            which have programming taking turns. If one of them reaches its full capacity, the screen
                            outside is switched on and you’ll be able to watch the show there, too. At your service!

                        <p>
                            Deaf Techno wristbands have been fitted with an RFID chip. At the
                            festival entrance you are given a chipped wristband in return for scanning in your festival
                            ticket. As of that point the RFID chip in the wristband is literally your key to the
                            festival. As was the case before, a fabric wristband, or long before that merely a stamp,
                            served as your key once the ticket had been checked.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Important: your entrance wristband and RFID chip must be worn at all times. It is your key
                            to the festival. You will not be allowed into the festival grounds without a wristband (and
                            without a chip). The RFID chip is not linked to your personal data.

                            In collaboration with Inter, Deaf Techno puts in a great effort to make the festival
                            accessible to the disabled. So we have paid a lot of attention to the accessibility of the

                                Both at the Main Stage, Club underground and the techno rave cave, we have provided

                                artists. We want to make sure that as many people as possible can use the platforms;
                                therefore only one friend/carer can accompany the festivalgoer with a disability on to
                                the platform.

                        <p>
                            Drivers are recommended to take the more direct route to the festival from their point of
                            departure. This will help spread the arrivals and departures and cause fewer traffic queues.
                            Important: trust the road signs and switch off your sat nav.
                        </p>
                        <h5>PARKING THE CAR</h5>
                        <p>
                            n the vicinity of the festival ground there are about ten car parks, divided into 3 zones
                            (A, B and C).
                            <br/><br/>
                            If you're not staying on one of the campsites in Gentbrugge, follow the highway signposting
                            to
                            the nearest available parking space. The signposting will be updated continuously.
                            <br/><br/>
                            If you are staying on one of the campsites in Gentbrugge, select the right route to the
                            nearest car park:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the parksites in a specific zone are full, you'll be directed to another parksite in a
                            different zone. Please keep an eye on the signposting by the road.
                            <br/><br/>
                            From parksite C16, you can take the free festival shuttle that takes you to the festival
                            site. The shuttle bus is going back and forth between the parksite and the festival site
                            continuously.
                            <br/><br/>
                            All parksites, with the exception of The Bunker parking, are run by local associations or
                            private individuals. For security related reasons, no cars, trailers and other vehicles are
                            allowed on the campsites. Wild camping – including camping on parksites – is strictly
                            forbidden by law.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Parking your car costs 20 euro (from Wednesday 26 June) or 15 euro (from Thursday 27 June),
                            regardsless of the duration. The parking fee is to be paid on the spot, in cash. The parking
                            ticket you'll receive is your proof of payment and should be placed behind your windshield.

                            Tip: are you using the car to drive back and forth to/from the festival? Please note the
                            parking fee is to be paid every time you access the parksite. We recommend using other -
                            more sustainable - methods of transportation, such as public transport, park & bike, etc.

                            Not run by the festival organization, are the Camping Regular campsites, all within walking
                            distance of the festival park. These campsites are rather basic, but no less enjoyable! The
                            Camping Regular campsites open on Thursday morning.

                            Bunker Resort - are run by local associations, not by the festival’s organizers. The latter

                            campsite supervisor. Of course, problems may be pointed out to the local authorities and to
                            the festival organizers as well. They have drawn up the rules
                            with regard to pricing, opening hours, number of toilets, wrist bands, lighting, firebreaks,

                            arrival. The idea is to leave the (full) bags in the dedicated area when you leave.

                            Deaf Techno does not call on individual volunteers. The festival has always drawn on a
                            broad spectrum of clubs and associations from the area in and around Gent. With great
                            passion and enthusiasm the members of these clubs get involved in whatever has to be done on
                            and around the festival ground. Their aim is to contribute to the success of the festival
                            and to raise funds for their organisation, because all partner clubs and associations earn a
                            fee from the festival organizers.

                            Does the name on your festival ticket not match with your own name? Don’t worry too much
                            about this! If the ticket was purchased via the official channels, it’s valid.

                            If the original buyer of the ticket does not accompany you when you enter the festival,
                            please make sure the condition of the ticket, the printing quality and especially the
                            barcode are impeccable. Print out your ticket on a white sheet of paper, and make sure the
                            other side remains unused. Dirty, wet or laminated tickets and badly printed or unclear
                            barcodes are not readable by the scanners. In that case, we can only give a copy of the
                            ticket to the original ticket buyer.

                            However, don’t buy your tickets via auction websites or second hand ticket websites. Tickets
                            that are offered for an exuberant amount of money, will be blacklisted and made invalid,
                            which means they don’t grant you access to the festival.

                        <p>
                            On and around the festival site, including on the campsites and on the public roads, it is
                            strictly prohibited to hand out or display flyers, posters or other promotional materials.
                            Sponsors and media partners - if they have agreed this with the organizers - get visibility
                            at the festival park.
